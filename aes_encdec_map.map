WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   clockDivider/GND_16_o_count[31]_equal_2_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin.
   This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of
   data into the flip-flop.

      to control set restrictions:              47 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
